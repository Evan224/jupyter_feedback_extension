What does this histogram tell you about urban and rural communes in Switzerland? Are there any clear outliers on either side, and if so, which communes?",

What quantity should be on the different axis? How to use colors and item sizes? It often helps to sketch the visualization by hand before coding it up. By doing that, we can also give ourselves a momen",
